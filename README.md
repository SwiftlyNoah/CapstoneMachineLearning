### Description
This was my first large-scall SwiftUI applicaiton at over 3000 lines of code. The app features two machine learning models (Convolutional Neural Networks) trained by me:
- A pneumonia detector: built on 20,000 Chest X-ray images, distinguishes x-rays as either healthy or presenting pneumonia
- A dog breed recognizer: built on 60,000 iamges of beloved dogs, can distinguish from 200+ breeds

The app was completed as the project portion for my middle school Capstone project on Machine Learning in Medicine. It accompanied my reserach paper which can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rqkmz87b3PH3fSchOVVJyfl5w871PqbC5KeXTP3uFD0/edit?usp=sharing) (don't judge the writing, I was 14)
